            <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
            <p>
              Our goal is to distribute information regarding various types of
              online scams to those who may not know such details. In the modern
              age of the Internet where technology is constantly evolving, it is
              imperative to be aware of the concurrent rise in cybercriminal
              activity as well as how to properly inhibit it.

            <h3>WHY IT'S IMPORTANT</h3>
            <p>
              Understanding what scams exist is the first step to avoiding them.
              Without this knowledge, an individual would likely become
              increasingly susceptible to the risks of having their personal
              information taken from them and utilized for illegal or unapproved
              acts. In order to prevent this theft from occurring, one must
              learn what to look out for and the proper actions to take in case
              they find themselves in such a situation.
